This program retrieves the maximum distance between distinct arrays

function maxDistance(ArrayArgument) {
    declare result to zero
    declare start with the first element of the first subArray
    declare end with the last element of the first subArray

    for (iterate the ArrayArgument from its second element) {
        set in result the maximum between result and
            the maximum of:
                - Absolute value of subtracting the last array element and the start field
                - Absolute value of subtracting the end field and the first array element
        set in start the minimum of start field and the first element of the array
        set in end the maximum of end field and the last element of the array
    end
    }

    return maximum distance
end
